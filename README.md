Sneaky Snake Game

Welcome to Sneaky Snake! This is a simple yet addictive game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer. Be careful not to run into the walls or your own tail, or it's game over!

How to Play:

  Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
  Guide the snake to eat the colored food dots that appear on the screen.
  Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer and you'll earn points.
  Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.

Features:

  Scoreboard: Keep track of your current score and highest score achieved.
  Game Over: When the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends, and you can restart by closing the window and rerunning the code.
