Sneaky Snake

Sneaky Snake is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.
Overview

Sneaky Snake is a simple and addictive game where players control a snake that grows in length as it eats food items. The goal is to guide the snake to consume as much food as possible without colliding with the walls of the game area or with its own tail.
